## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
In this project, I have used deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. I have trained and validated a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, I have then tried out my model on images of German traffic signs that I found on the web.


There is a detailed [writeup](https://github.com/akashmod/Self_Driving_Car_Traffic_Sign_Classifier_Project/blob/master/Writeup.md) of the project in the repository. The repository also contains the python code, [traffic_sign_classifier.ipynb](https://github.com/akashmod/Self_Driving_Car_Traffic_Sign_Classifier_Project/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb) developed in a jupyter notebook. There is also an HTML file of the code, in the repository, for viewing the code without using the jupyter notebook.

The Write-Up
---
The write-up includes the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/481/view) as well as my description of how I addressed each point.  I have included a detailed description of the code used in each step (with line-number references and code snippets where necessary), and links to other supporting documents or external references.  I have included images in my writeup to demonstrate how my code works with examples.  

The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Loading the data set
* Exploring, summarizing and visualizing the data set
* Designing, training and testing a model architecture
* Using the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyzing the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarizing the results with a written report
